/usr/local/Cellar/redis/2.8.19 (10 files, 1.4M) *
  Poured from bottle
From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/redis.rb
==> Caveats
To have launchd start redis at login:
    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/redis/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
Then to load redis now:
    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.redis.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
    redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
